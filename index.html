          I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from
          Winona State University and a Master’s Degree
          in Psychology from St. Mary’s University. My
          studies in psychology have provided me with
          ample communication skills that can be used in a
          wide range of jobs. I am eager to learn, calm
          under pressure, and a hands-on, goal-driven
          individual dedicated to continuous improvement
          and exceeding expectations.
